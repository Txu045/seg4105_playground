## Discussion

### Things I liked

I like the idea of appetite compared to the usual estimated hours of a feature. Working backwards from a solid number of hours available increases the chance that the feature will be finished on time.

### Things I disliked

I dislike the reliance as well as the disconnect between the designers shaping up the feature compared to the devs that will implement the feature. I feel even if wiggle room is left to the devs to decide on specific implementations, it will cause confusion and division between the two groups.

### Open ended

Not sure why six-weeks period is chosen? Two week sprints are frequent enough for the team to resync on the project and provide new insights to prep for the next sprint. Six-week cycles may be too distant and people might drift too much during that time.
