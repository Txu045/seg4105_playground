## Synopsis

Git repository created for SEG4105 - lab 7 according to lab instructions.

### Note

The original standup is part of our weekly meetings that is recorded in the wiki section of Yosoko project (though the wiki may be delayed by a few weeks). I realized there is then no way for the marker to mark the lab so I added my last stand up to the playground later. Though condensed past meetings can be still seen in the wiki section.

## Stand-up summary

I installed and integrated the Cypress testing framework to Yokoso. I created a simple integration test for the basic user flow of searching for a location in the homepage and selecting the first available listing to examine. I included the sample tests generated from Cypress for now for reference to be deleted later. I will automate the process of starting the integration tests on push to GitHub via actions so integration tests can happen automatically on push. I will also investigate possible reference tag issues for declaring objects to be more generalized so changing the css properties of certain objects will not break the tests.
