## Lab 9: Retrospective

### What things did you do that you think were awesome and should keep doing?

We think the features that are being worked on (after betting and choosing them) are awesome. The shape up process was amazing at scoping out the in-app chat/messaging and Stripe integration features, so we should continue using this process moving on. In particular, the shape up process helped pick out high-impact features while adjusting the scope to be manageable -- which helps us deliver the most value in the shortest amount of time.

### What are things you think you should stop doing, and why?

We think we should avoid miscommunication among the team members and the client. There were a couple of incidents where one group member thought they were working on one feature and so did another. This resulted in wasted time and work. We also had some miscommunication with our client where we did not fully understand the feature that he wanted. When we showed him the finished feature, there were many modifications to be made. In order to fix this, we held 2 weekly stand up meetings a week and had more frequent meetings with our client. Before ending each meeting, we would briefly summarize what was accomplished to ensure that everyone was on the same page.

### What new things would you like to try out?

For our upcoming sprint our team wants to try incorporating more check-in points throughout the development cycle. These check-ins will not be formal meetings, but rather a quick message discussing our progress to date. This will give us an opportunity to sync up as a team about the work we completed and discuss what tasks we are currently working on. It will also allow us to spot bottlenecks earlier into the development process and point out tasks that we might want to swarm.

In the previous sprint we tried to implement a development plan similar to base camp where we dedicated a few weeks solely to development with little overhead for meetings. We did find that the time spent productively but we did lose visibility of each other's progress, and realized that we could’ve spotted blockers earlier on in the development process if we had more open communication about our progress.

The way we plan on implementing this is similar to a virtual standup, where every couple of days we would send messages outlining the tasks we completed, what we are currently working on and what we will be working on next. We hope that through the implementation of virtual standups it will increase the team’s visibility on each other’s progress and help us spot blockers earlier on.

### What are things that are affecting your team but are outside the scope of control?

The most important items outside of our control included stakeholder availability and shifts in stakeholder expectations. We realized that our understanding of the feature does not match up 100% with stakeholder expectations and we continuously shifted our implementation during the cycle. This mismatch in expectation was due to additional functions being thought of later in the cycle by the stakeholder and the negotiation for these functions to be included or excluded from the feature. This compounded with the fact that our stakeholder availability is limited during our cycle is the biggest item that was out of our control.
